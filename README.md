# Projects
1. Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Report : In this project created a Report of various Machine Learning Tools used to do the task of Prediction, Classification and Regression. 

	In this used :
	* K - Nearest Neighbour Algorithm for Classification of instance of data     in Recur and Non Recur Patients.
	* K - Means Algorithm for Clustering and used elbow method for selecting     a suitable K in two clusters.
	* Simple Linear Regression using Cross Validation

2. Machine Learning Visualiser Application : In this Project made modules to visualise particular algorithms taking data in csv format as Input. 

	It can currently support
	* Polynomial Regression using QR Factorisation
	* Linear Regression using QR Factorisation
	* K - Means Clustering
	* Other Features are under development

3. Other R Apps : This directory conatins apps created for the purpose of better understanding the working of the shiny apps.

4. Search Engine in R : This directory contains the code for the search engine build using R. In this I had used tf-idf for document relavancy with the search query.

5. geodata : This directory contains the code to the Capston Project from Coursera that I had completed successfully. Using the Google Geocoding API with a Database and Visualizing data on Google Map. In this project, we are using the Google geocoding API to clean up some user-entered geographic locations of university names and then placing the data on a Google Map.

6. gmane : This directory contains the code to the 2nd Capston Project from Coursera. In this task was to analyze an EMAIL Archive vizualizing the data using the D3 JavaScript library. 

7. pagerank : This director contains the code for the 3rd Capston Project from Coursera. In this task was to create Simple Python Search Spider, Page Ranker, and Visualizer which I had completed successfully ;)
