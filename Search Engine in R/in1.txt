The mind is the set of cognitive faculties that enables consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement, and memory. The mind is the faculty of man's reasoning and thoughts. It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions. There is no universally agreed definition of what a mind is and what its distinguishing properties are, although there is a lengthy tradition of inquiries in philosophy, religion, psychology and cognitive science. The main open question regarding the nature of the mind is mindâ€“body problem, which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical brain and nervous system. Typical viewpoints include dualism and idealism, which consider the mind somehow separate from physical existence, and physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity. Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds, for example whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of man-made machines. Whatever its nature, it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have subjective awareness and intentionality towards their environment, to perceive and respond to stimuli with some kind of agency, and to have consciousness, including thinking and feeling.
